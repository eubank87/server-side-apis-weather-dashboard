# server-side-apis-weather-dashboard

For this assignment we were asked to create a webpage using a third-party API to access data about the weather.

After a user inputs a city name into the search field, they are presented with information about the current weather and a five day forecast for upcoming weather. Information is gathered about temperature, wind speed and humidity. There is also a picture icon for different weather patterns that displays. Finally, past search results generate new buttons on the side of the screen.

*Some functionality not complete:
    - UV index currently only displays 1 set of coordinates 
    - Past search buttons do not start new search
    - Local storage data does not display on page re-load

# Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS Bootstrap
    - jQuery
    - Class materials
    - Tutor session
